## Overview
This project builds a text classification model to categorize textual data into predefined classes using NLP and deep learning techniques.

## Tools Used
- **Python**
- **NLTK**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Pandas**
- **Gensim**
- **WordCloud**

## Machine Learning Models Used
- **Support Vector Machine**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Random Forest**
- **Ensemble Learning Methods**
- **LSTM**

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**  
   - Removed special characters, punctuation, and extra spaces.  
   - Converted text to lowercase and removed stopwords.  
   - Performed tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization for text standardization.

2. **Feature Engineering & Representation:**  
   - Implemented **TF-IDF** and **CountVectorizer** to convert text into numerical representations.  
   - Used **Word2Vec** embeddings for deep learning models.  

3. **Model Selection & Training:**  
   - Trained traditional ML models (Naïve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest).  
   - Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow (LSTM, CNN for text classification).  
   - Used word embeddings to improve accuracy.

4. **Model Evaluation & Optimization:**  
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision-recall, and confusion matrix.  
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal results.  

## Results
- Achieved **92% accuracy** in classifying text into predefined categories.  
- Improved classification performance using deep learning over traditional ML approaches.
